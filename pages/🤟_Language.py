We know there are $$360$$ English-language films, but we have to do a little work to find the number of other

We can add the **four categories** for Spanish, Hindi, French, and "other single" ($$ 29 + 27 + 15 + 51 = 122 $$). Or 
we can subtract the English and 'multiple' categories from the total ($$ 503 - 360 - 21 = 122 $$). This means the 
ratio of English films to non-English single-language films is **360 to 122**. Since $$ 360 / 122 = 2.95 $$, this means there are almost **3 English films** for every non-English film.
